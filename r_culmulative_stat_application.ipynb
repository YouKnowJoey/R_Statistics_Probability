Raymond has extensive histories of the three suppliers and knows that 3 percent of the chips purchased from Hall Electronics are defective, 5 percent of chips from Deltronics are defective and 4 percent of chips from Alpha are defective. When the chips arrive at the Raymond, they are placed directly in a bin and not inspected or otherwise identified by a supplier.
